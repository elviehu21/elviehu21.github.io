      <p style="font-size: 20px"> What is a menstrual cup?</p>
      <p>Stated simply, a menstrual cup is a reusable tampon alternative worn inside the vagina that collects flow rather than absorbing it. Cups come in all sizes and shapes to fit the wearer best and are most often made from medical grade silicone (but not always.) They are a safer, healthier, and more comfortable way to manage your period.</p>
      <p style="font-size: 20px">Can anyone wear a cup?</p>
      <p><em><strong>YES!</strong></em> Luckily there are all sizes, shapes, and styles of cup. We believe everyone can succeed with a cup as long as they find the right one (with VERY few exceptions). </p>
      <p style="font-size: 20px">Is wearing a cup messy?</p>
      <p><em><strong>Not at all!</strong></em> Even when removing the cup you should have little to no blood on your hands- remove while over the toilet or in the shower.</p>
      <p style="font-size: 20px">Can acup get lost inside you?</p>
      <p><em><strong>No.</strong></em> At the end of your vaginal canal is the cervix (the opening to the uterus) and it won’t allow anything past it… except sperm.</p>
      <p> If your cup is “lost” and you can’t reach it, again, remember it’s not going anywhere. Use your muscles to work the cup down low enough to reach by bearing down, the same strain you use to poop. Once you can reach it pinch the base to break the seal and remove. </p>
